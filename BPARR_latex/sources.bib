This paper explores how public opinions might differ between survey and social media platforms in terms of content and audience, focusing on the test case of opinions about autonomous vehicles. The paper first extends previous overviews comparing surveys and social media as measurement tools to include a broader range of survey types, including surveys that result from public deliberation, considering the dialogic characteristics of different social media, and the range of issue publics and marginalized voices that different surveys and social media forums can attract. It then compares findings and implications from analyses of public opinion about autonomous vehicles from traditional surveys, results of public deliberation, and analyses of Reddit posts, applying a newly developed computational text analysis tool. Findings demonstrate that social media analyses can both help researchers learn more about issues that are uncovered by surveys and also uncover opinions from subpopulations with specialized knowledge and unique orientations toward a subject. In light of these findings, we point to future directions on how researchers and policymakers can synthesize survey and social media data, and the corresponding data integration techniques, to study public opinion.}",

	abstract = {Data-based research approaches to generate crash scenarios have mainly relied on conventional vehicle crashes and naturalistic driving data, and have not considered differences between the autonomous vehicle (AV) and conventional vehicle crashes. As the AV’s presence on roadways continues to grow, its crash scenarios take on new importance for traffic safety. This study therefore obtained crash patterns using the United States Department of Transportation pre-crash scenario typology, and used statistical analysis to determine the differences between AV and conventional vehicle pre-crash scenarios. Analysis of 122 AV crashes and 2084 conventional vehicle crashes revealed 15 types of scenario for AVs and 26 for conventional vehicles. The two groups showed differences in type of scenario, and differed in the proportion of crashes when the scenario was the same. The most frequent AV pre-crash scenarios were rear-end collisions (52.46\%) and lane change collisions (18.85\%), with the proportion of AVs rear-ended by conventional vehicles occurring with a frequency 1.6 times that of conventional vehicles. An in-depth crash investigation was conducted of the characteristics and causes of four AV pre-crash scenarios, summarized from the perspectives of perception and path planning. The perception-reaction time (PRT) difference between AVs and human drivers, AV’s inaccurate identification of the intention of other vehicles to change lanes, and AV’s insufficient path planning combining time and space dimensions were found to be important causes for the AV crashes. By increasing understanding of the complex characteristics of AV pre-crash scenarios, this analysis will encourage cooperation with vehicle manufacturers and AV technology companies for further study of crash causation toward the goals of improved test scenario construction and optimization of the AV’s automated driving system (ADS).}

	abstract = {Autonomous or automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve traffic safety by eliminating majority of human errors. As the interest in AV deployment increases, there is an increasing need to assess and understand the expected implications of AVs on traffic safety. Until recently, most of the literature has been based on either survey questionnaires, simulation analysis, virtual reality, or simulation to assess the safety benefits of AVs. Although few studies have used AV crash data, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have not been a topic of interest. Therefore, this study uses crash narratives from four-year (2017–2020) of AV crash data collected from California to explore the direct and indirect involvement of VRUs. The study applied text network and compared the text classification performance of four classifiers - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN) and associated performance metrics to attain the objective. It was found that out of 252 crashes, VRUs were, directly and indirectly, involved in 23 and 12 crashes, respectively. Among VRUs, bicyclists and scooterists are more likely to be involved in the AV crashes directly, and bicyclists are likely to be at fault, while pedestrians appear more in the indirectly involvements. Further, crashes that involve VRUs indirectly are likely to occur when the AVs are in autonomous mode and are slightly involved minor damages on the rear bumper than the ones that directly involve VRUs. Additionally, feature importance from the best performing classifiers (RF and NN) revealed that crosswalks, intersections, traffic signals, movements of AVs (turning, slowing down, stopping) are the key predictors of the VRUs-AV related crashes. These findings can be helpful to AV operators and city planners.}

	title={Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles},

	abstract={This document describes [motor] vehicle driving automation systems that perform part or all of the dynamic driving task (DDT) on a sustained basis. It provides a taxonomy with detailed definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging from no driving automation (Level 0) to full driving automation (Level 5), in the context of [motor] vehicles (hereafter also referred to as “vehicle” or “vehicles”) and their operation on roadways: Level 0: No Driving Automation Level 1: Driver Assistance Level 2: Partial Driving Automation Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation Level 4: High Driving Automation Level 5: Full Driving Automation These level definitions, along with additional supporting terms and definitions provided herein, can be used to describe the full range of driving automation features equipped on [motor] vehicles in a functionally consistent and coherent manner. “On-road” refers to publicly accessible roadways (including parking areas and private campuses that permit public access) that collectively serve all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians, and users of vehicles with and without driving automation features. The levels apply to the driving automation feature(s) that are engaged in any given instance of on-road operation of an equipped vehicle. As such, although a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of delivering multiple driving automation features that perform at different levels, the level of driving automation exhibited in any given instance is determined by the feature(s) that are engaged. This document also refers to three primary actors in driving: the (human) user, the driving automation system, and other vehicle systems and components. These other vehicle systems and components (or the vehicle in general terms) do not include the driving automation system in this model, even though as a practical matter a driving automation system may actually share hardware and software components with other vehicle systems, such as a processing module(s) or operating code. The levels of driving automation are defined by reference to the specific role played by each of the three primary actors in performance of the DDT and/or DDT fallback. “Role” in this context refers to the expected role of a given primary actor, based on the design of the driving automation system in question and not necessarily to the actual performance of a given primary actor. For example, a driver who fails to monitor the roadway during engagement of a Level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) system still has the role of driver, even while s/he is neglecting it. Active safety systems, such as electronic stability control (ESC) and automatic emergency braking (AEB), and certain types of driver assistance systems, such as lane keeping assistance (LKA), are excluded from the scope of this driving automation taxonomy because they do not perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis, but rather provide momentary intervention during potentially hazardous situations. Due to the momentary nature of the actions of active safety systems, their intervention does not change or eliminate the role of the driver in performing part or all of the DDT, and thus are not considered to be driving automation, even though they perform automated functions. In addition, systems that inform, alert, or warn the driver about hazards in the driving environment are also outside the scope of this driving automation taxonomy, as they neither automate part or all of the DDT, nor change the driver’s role in performance of the DDT (see 8.13). It should be noted, however, that crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be included in vehicles equipped with driving automation systems at any level. For automated driving system (ADS) features (i.e., Levels 3 to 5) that perform the complete DDT, crash mitigation and avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality (see also 8.13).}

	abstract = {We present four new reinforcement learning algorithms based on actor–critic, natural-gradient and function-approximation ideas, and we provide their convergence proofs. Actor–critic reinforcement learning methods are online approximations to policy iteration in which the value-function parameters are estimated using temporal difference learning and the policy parameters are updated by stochastic gradient descent. Methods based on policy gradients in this way are of special interest because of their compatibility with function-approximation methods, which are needed to handle large or infinite state spaces. The use of temporal difference learning in this way is of special interest because in many applications it dramatically reduces the variance of the gradient estimates. The use of the natural gradient is of interest because it can produce better conditioned parameterizations and has been shown to further reduce variance in some cases. Our results extend prior two-timescale convergence results for actor–critic methods by Konda and Tsitsiklis by using temporal difference learning in the actor and by incorporating natural gradients. Our results extend prior empirical studies of natural actor–critic methods by Peters, Vijayakumar and Schaal by providing the first convergence proofs and the first fully incremental algorithms.}
